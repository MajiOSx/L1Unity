		<desc class="0" stat="-1" name="royal">Princes/Princesses

This class takes on the 
role of a leader. A good 
Prince/Princess has the 
charisma to motivate 
his/her troops when 
going into battle and to 
help them to realize the 
ultimate goal of the 
Blood Pledge. Whether 
that goal is to take over 
and own a castle or just 
simply to have fun and 
hunt well together, this 
class is the only one 
that can form Blood 
Pledges and hold a throne.

Though Knights are 
stronger, Wizards know 
much more magic and Elves 
are more versatile, the 
noble Princes/Princesses 
are respectable fighters 
and are absolutely 
essential for leading 
the masses.

The royal bloods start 
their life in Lineage in 
the village on Singing 
Island.

		<desc class="1" stat="-1" name="knight">Knights

The Knight is the easiest 
character for a new 
player to play. One should 
set up their Knight with 
plenty of strength, as 
they specialize in 
hand-to-hand combat.

Knights are fierce 
warriors and, as such, 
have the ability to use 
more armor and weapons 
than any other class, 
making them effective in 
both giving and absorbing 
damage.

The downside of being a
Knight is that they are 
virtually unable to cast
magical spells. They are 
dependent on potions and 
scrolls or friendly party 
members for magical 
support.
  
Knights have a vested 
interest in seeking the 
patronage of a powerful 
Blood Pledge leader. The 
ability that Knights have 
to effectively fight is 
complemented by the 
organized battles and 
protection a good pledge 
can offer a Knight.  

New player Knights begin 
their adventures in Hidden 
Valley.

		<desc class="2" stat="-1" name="elf">Elves

The Elves are a long-living 
and beautiful race. They 
tend to live close to 
nature, rejecting technology 
and elite monetary status 
that you find in most modern 
societies. They are 
naturally graceful and 
dexterous which make them 
most adept in the use of 
long-range weapons.

Their stature is smaller 
than that of Knights but are 
still able to handle most 
weapons. Their rich culture 
includes a unique form of 
magic known only unto their 
race. Elves are well-balanced 
in their physical and mental 
capabilities.

Life as an Elf starts in the 
Elven Village, under the 
Mother Tree. Elves often 
congregate under the Mother 
Tree because their HP and MP 
recover quickly beneath her 
nurturing branches.

Another important component 
in the life of an Elf is the 
guardians that live in the 
Elven Forest. They assist 
the Elves when they are 
under attack and they make 
many of the components 
necessary for the much sought 
after Elven objects obtained 
through Nerupa.

		<desc class="3" stat="-1" name="mage">Wizards

This is the intellectual 
class. They delve deeply 
into understanding the 
intricacies of nature 
and energy, defying both 
and calling to their will 
the mysterious power of 
the world.

Wizards concentrate on 
strengthening their 
mental abilities, to 
power the mana for casting 
spells, rather than 
building their physical 
skills. Their hand-to-hand 
combat skills are usually 
minimal but the amount of 
devastation a high-level 
Wizard can do, is pretty 
incredible. 

Wizards are extremely 
helpful to have in parties, 
as well. Their attack 
abilities are powerful and 
their healing abilities can 
be crucial to success.

A Wizard starts life in the 
village on Singing Island.

		<desc class="4" stat="-1" name="dark_elf">Dark Elves

They were born to and 
lived their lives in 
darkness.

One day, a much respected 
member of the tribes 
stood up as leader to 
challenge their beliefs 
and he spoke to them as 
follows.

"This world must no longer 
soil our tribe with blood 
in meaningless wars. Using 
our own methods, we will 
defy the ones who have 
destroyed order in this 
dark world and replaced it 
with chaos."

That challenged the core of 
how the tribespeople had 
lived up until that moment.

Those who followed his 
ideals ended up being chased 
away and fled to remote 
regions. They set up in a 
location, far from other
civilizations, living on the 
edge of light and darkness...

Having strong attack strength 
and quick body movements, 
Dark Elves are a class 
specializing in close combat.
